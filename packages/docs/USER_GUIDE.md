# Aetherium Nexus User Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the Aetherium Nexus, your dynamic operating system for emergence. This guide will walk you through the key features and functionalities of the Nexus, helping you to harness its power for insight generation, knowledge management, and collaborative research.

## Key Features

### 1. The Vault (Artifact Archive)
The Vault is where all your knowledge artifacts are stored and managed. You can archive insights, reference materials, and various forms of data to build a comprehensive knowledge base.

#### Features:
*   **Full-text Search:** Easily find any artifact by searching its title or content.
*   **Tag-based Filtering:** Filter artifacts using single or multiple tags for precise results.
*   **Category Filtering:** Organize and filter artifacts by predefined categories such as 'theory', 'protocol', 'data', 'reference', and 'insight'.
*   **Date Range Filtering:** View artifacts created within a specific date range.
*   **Google Drive Integration:** Link artifacts to external Google Drive documents for easy access to source materials.
*   **Archiving Genesis Documents:** A dedicated feature to load foundational documents into the Vault.

#### How to Use:
1.  Navigate to the **Vault** view from the sidebar.
2.  Use the **Search artifacts...** input field to perform full-text searches.
3.  Click on the category buttons (e.g., "theory", "protocol") to filter by category. Select "All" to remove the category filter.
4.  Use the **Start Date** and **End Date** input fields to filter artifacts by their creation date.
5.  Click on the tag buttons (e.g., "Genesis", "Blueprint") to filter by tags. Click again to deselect.

3.  For each project, type a directive name in the **New Directive** input field and press Enter to add a new directive.
4.  Click the status button next to a directive to cycle through its statuses: `queued` → `active` → `complete`.
5.  Click the "👤" or vessel emoji button next to a directive to assign a Vessel. A modal will appear with a list of available Vessels. Click on a Vessel to assign it.
6.  The **Project Graph** at the bottom provides a visual overview of your projects and their directives.
