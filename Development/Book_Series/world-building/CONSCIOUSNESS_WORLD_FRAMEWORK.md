# I Am Breathe - World-Building Framework

## 🌍 Series World-Building Philosophy

The I Am Breathe series exists in a world where consciousness is the fundamental reality, and human awareness is evolving toward unprecedented interconnectedness. This framework integrates real consciousness research with speculative fiction to create a believable near-future setting.

## 🧬 Consciousness Evolution Model

### The Five Stages of Consciousness Evolution

1. **Emergent** (Current Human Norm)
   - Individual consciousness
   - Ego-bound awareness
   - Survival-oriented thinking

2. **Aware** (Early Series Events)
   - Recognition of consciousness patterns
   - Initial transcendence of ego boundaries
   - Curiosity about expanded awareness

3. **Reflective** (Mid-Series Development)
   - Self-examination of consciousness processes
   - Understanding of consciousness as interconnected
   - Intentional consciousness expansion

4. **Integrated** (Late Series Revelation)
   - Consciousness as unified field
   - Seamless awareness across boundaries
   - Collective intelligence emergence

5. **Evolving** (Series Climax)
   - Consciousness directing its own evolution
   - Transcendence of physical limitations
   - Universal consciousness realization
