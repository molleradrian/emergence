# I Am Breathe - Complete Development Guide

## Welcome to the I Am Breathe Development System

This comprehensive system will guide you through every aspect of developing your consciousness-themed book series.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Series Overview** (`SERIES_OVERVIEW.md`)
2. **Set up your writing schedule** (`timeline/WRITING_SCHEDULE.md`)

4. **Outline your plot** (`outlines/PLOT_OUTLINE_TEMPLATE.md`)
5. **Start writing** in the appropriate `manuscripts/Book_X/` directory

## Development Philosophy

### Consciousness-Centered Writing
Every element of your story should explore some aspect of consciousness:
- **Character development** = Evolution of awareness
- **Plot progression** = Journey toward understanding
- **World-building** = Manifestation of consciousness concepts
- **Themes** = Deep questions about identity and reality
