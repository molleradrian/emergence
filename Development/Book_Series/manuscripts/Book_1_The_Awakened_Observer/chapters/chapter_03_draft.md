Dr. Aria Chen stared at her computer screen, the anomalous neural patterns from Marcus Hale's scan mocking her with their impossibility. The data was irrefutable—brain activity that suggested consciousness extending beyond neural boundaries—but every conventional explanation she'd tested had failed.

*This isn't just bad data,* she thought. *This is data that shouldn't exist.*

She needed a fresh perspective, someone who could approach this from a different angle. Someone who understood the mind not just as neurons firing, but as a psychological phenomenon.

Her thoughts turned to Dr. Michael Torres. They had collaborated on a few interdisciplinary projects over the years—nothing major, but enough to establish mutual respect. Michael was a clinical psychologist with a background in neuropsychology, known for his thoughtful approach to consciousness studies.

More importantly, he was known for being open-minded about phenomena that others dismissed as pseudoscience.

Aria picked up her phone, hesitating for a moment before dialing his number. "Dr. Torres? This is Aria Chen from the neuroscience department. I wonder if you might have time to discuss some... unusual findings."

Michael Torres's office was exactly what Aria had expected: floor-to-ceiling bookshelves groaning under the weight of psychology texts, comfortable armchairs arranged for intimate conversations, and the faint scent of herbal tea lingering in the air.

"Aria Chen," Michael said, rising from behind his cluttered desk with a warm smile. "It's been too long. Please, have a seat. What's this mysterious data that's got you crossing departmental lines?"

Aria settled into the armchair, pulling out her tablet. "I wish I could say this was routine, but... it's not. I've encountered neural patterns that defy current understanding of consciousness."

Michael's eyebrows rose as he leaned forward. "Defy understanding? That's a strong claim. Show me."

For the next twenty minutes, Aria walked him through the data—Sarah's initial anomalous scan, Marcus Hale's impossible readings, the reproducible patterns that suggested consciousness extending beyond individual brains.

Michael listened intently, occasionally interrupting with clarifying questions. His initial skepticism was evident in his furrowed brow and probing inquiries, but Aria noticed how his eyes lit up when she described the subjects' subjective experiences.

"Consciousness bleeding through," he murmured when she finished. "Shared awareness fields. This is fascinating, but I have to ask—have you considered that this might be a measurement artifact?"

Aria nodded. "Of course. I've run every diagnostic protocol. Equipment is functioning perfectly. Statistical analysis shows these patterns are significant beyond any reasonable margin of error."

Michael leaned back, steepling his fingers. "Then we're dealing with something extraordinary. From a psychological perspective, this suggests consciousness isn't confined to individual neural networks. It implies... interconnectedness. Shared consciousness fields."

"Fields?" Aria echoed, her scientific training bristling at the term.

Michael smiled. "I know, it sounds New Age. But consider: what if consciousness operates like a field effect? Not just localized in individual brains, but creating interference patterns between minds?"

Aria felt a spark of recognition. "Like quantum entanglement, but for consciousness?"

"Exactly," Michael said, his eyes bright with excitement. "The patterns you're seeing—those aren't random artifacts. They're evidence of consciousness interacting at a fundamental level."

Despite her initial resistance, Aria found herself intrigued. Michael's perspective offered a framework for understanding the impossible data that her neuroscience background alone couldn't provide.

"But how do we test this?" she asked. "How do we move beyond observation to experimentation?"

Michael's smile widened. "That's where the real fun begins. We design experiments that bridge neuroscience and psychology. We create controlled conditions to test consciousness field effects."

As they discussed potential methodologies, Aria felt the first stirrings of genuine collaboration. Michael's psychological insights complemented her technical expertise, creating a whole greater than the sum of its parts.

By the time their meeting ended, they had the outline of a research partnership. Michael would provide the psychological framework and subject recruitment, while Aria handled the technical implementation.

Walking back to her lab, Aria felt a weight lift from her shoulders. The anomalous data was no longer hers alone to bear. And for the first time since those impossible scans, she allowed herself to feel a spark of hope that they might actually understand what was happening.
