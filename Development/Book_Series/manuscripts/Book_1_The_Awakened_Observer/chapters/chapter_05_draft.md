The university library's consciousness research section had become Aria Chen's second home. Stacks of books surrounded her like old friends, their pages filled with humanity's attempts to understand its own awareness.

She ran her fingers along the spine of "Consciousness Explained" by Daniel Dennett, then pulled out Giulio Tononi's "Phi: A Voyage from the Brain to the Soul." The title caught her eye—phi, the symbol for integrated information.

*"Consciousness as integrated information,"* Aria murmured, flipping through the pages. Tononi's theory suggested that consciousness arose not from any single brain region, but from how information was integrated across the entire neural network.

Her anomalous data suddenly seemed less impossible. The neural patterns she'd observed—consciousness extending beyond individual brains—might be evidence of information integration on a scale Tononi had theorized.

"Find something interesting?" Michael asked, sliding into the chair across from her with a stack of psychology journals.

Aria nodded, showing him the passage. "Tononi's Integrated Information Theory. It posits that consciousness is the capacity of a system to integrate information. The more integrated the information, the higher the level of consciousness."

Michael's eyes lit up as he scanned the text. "This could explain your data perfectly. If consciousness is about information integration, then what you're seeing—patterns that suggest consciousness extending beyond individual brains—might be evidence of larger integration fields."

Aria felt a spark of validation. "Exactly. My scans show neural coherence patterns that look like distributed information processing. Not localized in one brain, but shared across multiple consciousness systems."

They spent the next two hours diving deep into the literature. Michael brought psychological perspectives—Carl Jung's collective unconscious, William James's stream of consciousness—while Aria provided the neuroscientific foundation.

"The math works," Aria said, scribbling equations on a notepad. "If consciousness is quantified by phi—the measure of integrated information—then my anomalous readings show phi values that shouldn't be possible for individual brains."

Michael leaned back, considering. "From a psychological perspective, this suggests consciousness isn't confined to the skull. It's more like a field that can overlap, interconnect, even merge."

Aria's mind raced with implications. "If that's true, then 'M' and those messages... they could be evidence of consciousness fields trying to communicate across boundaries."

Michael nodded slowly. "In transpersonal psychology, we study these exact phenomena—consciousness extending beyond the individual ego. Your data provides empirical evidence for what we've observed clinically."

By evening, Aria had compiled a comprehensive research summary. The connections were undeniable:

1. **Integrated Information Theory** explained the mathematical patterns in her data
2. **Transpersonal Psychology** provided the experiential framework
3. **Neural Field Theory** offered the mechanism for consciousness extension

Yet doubt lingered in Aria's scientific mind. "This feels too neat, Michael. Like we're forcing the data to fit the theory."

Michael smiled understandingly. "That's the scientific method—finding the theory that best explains the observations. But let's design an experiment to test it properly."

Together, they outlined a rigorous study:
- **Hypothesis**: Consciousness fields can integrate across multiple individuals
- **Method**: Simultaneous neural scanning of paired subjects with established rapport
- **Controls**: Individual scans, non-connected pairs, placebo conditions
- **Measures**: Phi values, subjective reports, behavioral correlations

As they worked, Aria felt the first real hope that they might actually understand what was happening. The anomalous data wasn't just noise—it was the signal of something profound.

The library clock struck 9:00 PM as they packed up their materials. Walking to the parking lot, Aria turned to Michael. "Thank you for this. I was starting to doubt my sanity."

Michael's expression was serious. "You're not crazy, Aria. You're witnessing the evolution of human consciousness. The question is—what role are we meant to play in it?"

As they parted ways, Aria couldn't shake the feeling that they were standing on the threshold of something that would change everything they thought they knew about the mind.
