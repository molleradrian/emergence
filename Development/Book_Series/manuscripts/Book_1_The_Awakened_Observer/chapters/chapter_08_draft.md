Aria Chen stared at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, but the face looking back wasn't quite right. The eyes seemed too large, the expression subtly different from what she felt on her face.

*Get a grip,* she told herself, splashing water on her face. *It's just fatigue from the experiment.*

But as she walked back to her living room, the walls seemed to breathe—subtle undulations that made her question her vision. The bookshelf on the far wall appeared to shift slightly, as if the books were rearranging themselves.

"Aria?" Michael's voice on the phone was concerned. "You sound distracted. How are you feeling after the merge?"

She hesitated, not wanting to sound irrational. "Fine. Just tired. The data is incredible though—the consciousness field effects were stronger than we predicted."

"That's what I wanted to talk about," Michael said. "I've been experiencing some... perceptual anomalies too. Nothing major, but colors seem more vivid, and I occasionally feel like I'm picking up on others' emotional states."

Aria's heart rate increased. "You're experiencing aftereffects too?"

"It's not uncommon with intense consciousness work," Michael said reassuringly. "The mind can take time to reintegrate after such profound experiences."

But Aria's symptoms escalated. That evening, while preparing dinner, she reached for a knife and watched in horror as it seemed to multiply—two knives, three, four—before snapping back to one.

"Michael," she called him back, her voice trembling. "Something's wrong with my vision."

By morning, the distortions had intensified. Aria sat in her office, trying to focus on her computer screen, but the text seemed to shift and reform, sentences blending into abstract patterns.

*This isn't real,* she told herself. *It's a psychological reaction to the merge.*

But when she looked up at her colleague across the hall, she saw double—two versions of Dr. Sarah Martinez, slightly out of sync, as if consciousness fields were creating interference patterns in her visual cortex.

"Aria? Are you alright?" Sarah asked, noticing her stare.

Aria blinked hard, and the double image resolved into one. "Fine. Just... tired eyes."

She escaped to the bathroom, where the mirror showed her reflection with eyes that seemed to swirl with impossible patterns—fractals that couldn't exist in human irises.

Panic rising, Aria called Michael. "I need you to come over. Now."

When he arrived, she described everything—the visual distortions, the sense of dual reality, the feeling that her consciousness was still partially merged with something beyond herself.

Michael listened carefully, his psychologist's training evident in his calm demeanor. "This could be a prolonged consciousness field effect," he said. "The merge may have temporarily altered your perceptual processing."

"But it's getting worse," Aria said, her voice small.

Michael took her hands. "We're in this together, Aria. Let's document everything systematically. We can use this as data for understanding consciousness field consequences."

Together, they began cataloging the anomalies:
- Visual distortions and pattern formation
- Emotional sensitivity to others' mental states
- Occasional auditory hallucinations of whispered thoughts
- A persistent sense of being observed by something beyond physical senses

As the day progressed, Aria felt the first flickers of doubt about her sanity. The scientific part of her mind screamed for rational explanations—stress, fatigue, experimental contamination—while another part, the part that had experienced the merge, whispered that reality itself was changing.

That night, as she lay in bed, the ceiling seemed to dissolve into star fields of neural activity. Michael's voice echoed in her mind, not as memory but as present awareness: *"You're not alone in this, Aria."*

For the first time since beginning this journey, Aria Chen wondered if understanding consciousness might cost her the very sanity she sought to comprehend.
